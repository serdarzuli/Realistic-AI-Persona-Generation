# Custom LoRA Project: Realistic AI Persona Generation

This project is the result of a custom LoRA training process built entirely from scratch using my own dataset. As you can see from the sample images shared below, the AI-generated characters were created to reflect a highly consistent identity, emotional tone, and stylistic personality.

Every character in this portfolio was generated through a LoRA model I trained myself. The process included organizing a dataset, creating captions, training a model, and integrating it into advanced ComfyUI workflows for both image and video production.

If you have an idea or vision for a character or visual concept that you want to bring to life with AI, feel free to reach out. I’m open to collaborations, creative projects, and custom AI model development.
